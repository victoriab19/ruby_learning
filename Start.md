ok, First you need to know that i am guiding you like we start learning Java or C++

1. Download and install the ruby from here. http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167
it will provide you a cmd, from where we will run the code.

2. After installation, Go to Start. Find "Ruby 2.0 etc". Click on "Start Command Prompt with Ruby". 

3. In C drive. Make a folder where you will place the ruby files. I am using a Ruby folder.

4. Create a file with name "test.rb"

5. Enter this line in the file, (puts "Hello World!!!")

6.from the Command Prompt with Ruby. Go to this folder. and enter. C:\Ruby>ruby test.rb

7. you will see Hello World!!!. It was our first code in Ruby.

puts statement is a way to show output like
"puts" writes to the screen with a carriage return at the end. 
"print" does the same thing without the carriage return. 
"printf" formats variables like in C and Java 5.

You will get more basic details from http://www.fincher.org/tips/Languages/Ruby/
